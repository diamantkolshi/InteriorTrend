# Dependencies for testing and development. To let appraisal override them, we
# do NOT put them in group :test,:development -- which anyway doesn't make a
# lot of sense in a gem Gemfile anyway, there is no "production" in a gem Gemfile.
#
# We also have these development dependencies here in the Gemfile instead of the
# gemspec so appraisal can override them from our Appraisal file.

# all of rails is NOT a dependency, just activerecord.
# But we use it for integration testing with combustion. Hmm, a bit annoying
# that now our other tests can't be sure they're depending, this might not
# be the way to do it.
